Welcome to my publications page.

You'll find a strong focus on cancer genomics, spanning everything from individual case reports to large-scale genomic studies and clinical trials. A few papers also highlight my contributions to bioinformatics software development. As of now, I have {{ total }} published papers — and there's always more to come. I aim to keep this list current, so feel free to check back periodically.
