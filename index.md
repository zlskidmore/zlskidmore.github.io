# Welcome

Hi, I’m Zach — and welcome to my **personal website** powered by Jekyll + Bootstrap + FontAwesome.

I’m a bioinformatician by training, with a deep interest in tackling some of the most pressing and often cruel health challenges of our time. For the bulk of my career, I’ve worked in cancer research under the mentorship of [Obi and Malachi Griffith](https://griffithlab.org), contributing to projects across a wide range of tumor types and molecular technologies. More recently, I transitioned into industry, where I’ve focused on translating that expertise into real-world healthcare impact.
You can learn more about my published work on the Publications page, or visit the About section for a more personal look into both my professional background and broader interests.

#### Why This Site?
I created this site for two main reasons: <br>
- First, I wanted a space outside the constraints of boilerplate social media to showcase my research, experience, and ongoing projects. A place that felt more intentional. <br><br>
- Second, and just as important, I’ve reached a point in my career where I’ve accumulated a wide breadth of domain knowledge across bioinformatics, cancer genomics, data science, and more. Retaining deep familiarity across that spread is no small feat. This site also serves as a living notebook of sorts: a place to archive my personal cliff notes, insights, and tutorials. I’ve chosen to make those public in the hopes they may help others navigating similar problems.


#### What You'll Find Here
The blog will reflect a mostly professional tone, with a strong focus on: <br>
* <i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> Programming in R
* <i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Statistical methods and data science
* <i class="fas fa-dna"></i> Cancer genomics and bioinformatics<br>

From time to time, you may find the occasional off-topic post, too.
If you come across an error in a post or have a different perspective to share, I welcome the discussion — feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/zlskidmore/zlskidmore.github.io/issues) and start a conversation on GitHub. <br><br>
Thanks for stopping by, I hope you find something here that’s useful! <br>
