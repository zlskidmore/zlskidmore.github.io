### A bit about me and my interests

I’m a bioinformatician with over a decade of experience in cancer genomics, data science, and computational biology. My work centers on connecting biological insight with computational rigor, developing and applying analytical frameworks to understand complex molecular data in ways that inform both novel discovery and clinical translation.

What continues to drive me is a deep sense of curiosity, the desire to understand how systems work, why they fail, and how data can reveal meaning hidden beneath complexity. That same curiosity shaped my career path early on, I fondly remember watching Star Trek late at night during my childhood, which first sparked my fascination with science and exploration, and that spirit of inquiry has remained a constant through every project I’ve taken on.

I’ve contributed to more than forty peer-reviewed publications and several open-source tools spanning cancer biology, sequencing analysis, and applied machine learning. Beyond research, I maintain this site and hope to expand it as a way to not only remind myself of what i've done and learned, but also share knowledge with the broader bioinformatics community, whether by demystifying core methods, discussing computational design, or reflecting on the evolving intersection between biology and data science.

Outside of research, I try to maintain balance through active pursuits like climbing or riding a onewheel, which sharpen focus and remind me of the importance of adaptability and precision. I’m also drawn to history, design, and the quiet nostalgia of old libraries and academic spaces — influences that keep me grounded in both the past and the pursuit of discovery.

I’ve had the opportunity to travel across much of the United States, the Carribean, and Eastern Europe, experiences that reinforced my appreciation for how culture, history, and perspective shape scientific collaboration.

If you’re interested in connecting, whether for collaboration, mentorship, or new opportunities, I welcome thoughtful outreach. You can reach me through the Contact page or find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-skidmore-0799653a/).
